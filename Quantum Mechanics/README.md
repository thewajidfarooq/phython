# Quantum Mechanics

## Overview
The **Quantum Mechanics** folder contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and associated files that explore various fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics. The materials are designed for students, educators, and enthusiasts who want to deepen their understanding of quantum principles, mathematical formulations, and applications.

## Contents
- **Infinite Square Well 1.ipynb**: 
  - An exploration of the infinite square well model, including mathematical derivations of wave functions and energy levels, along with visualizations of probability densities.
  
- **Quantum Harmonic Oscillator.ipynb**: 
  - A study of the quantum harmonic oscillator, focusing on its energy quantization, wave functions, and physical implications in quantum mechanics.

- **Spin and Quantum States.ipynb**: 
  - An examination of quantum spin, including the representation of spin states, measurement, and the implications of entanglement.

- **Additional Resources**: 
  - A folder containing supplementary materials, such as reference articles, textbooks, and lecture notes that provide additional context and information on quantum mechanics topics.
